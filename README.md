# 👋 Hi, I'm Dario

🎓 I'm currently studying Full-Stack Web Development at **Code Institute**.  
💻 I love building websites that are not only beautiful, but also functional and user-friendly.  
🎯 I'm focused on mastering **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and **Python**.

## 🚀 Projects & Learning Journey
On my GitHub, you'll find:
- Web projects created during my studies
- Personal experiments and practice repositories
- My learning progress toward becoming a full-stack developer

## 🥁 A bit about me  
Outside of coding, I enjoy playing and creating music (I'm a drummer!), and I also enjoy playing video games in my free time.
